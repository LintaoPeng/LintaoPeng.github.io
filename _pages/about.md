Thank you for visiting my website! I'm Lintao Peng, currently a Ph.D. student at [Computational Sensing Lab](https://bianlab.github.io/), Beijing Insitute of Technology, advised by Prof. [Liheng Bian](https://bianlab.github.io/). Previously, I received my B. Eng in Computer Science and Technology in Xidian University.

My current research interests are mainly about computational imaging and sensing. Specifically, I focus on deep-learning-based imaging and sensing techniques in complex environments. Also I investigate deeper with various self-attention mechanisms and uncertainty driven loss to improve the performance of the imaging and sensing networks.
