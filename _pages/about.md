Thank you for visiting my website!

I am currently studying for a master's degree at [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://bianlab.github.io/), majoring in electronic information engineering, and my research interests are computational photography and deep learning. From 2016 to 2020, I obtained a bachelor's degree in computer science and technology from [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/). During 2018, I went to [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) for exchange study, and I was an intern at [Alibaba](https://azft.alibaba.com/) in 2019.

The wide-field high-resolution imaging system is my first project since I enrolled in my master's degree. The phased results have been published on [Optica Express](https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-29-22-35602&id=460571), and we are still continuing to study this topic. In detail, we use a short-focal camera to image a wide field with a certain low resolution and use a long-focal camera to acquire the HR images of ROI. To automatically locate ROI in the wide field in real time, we propose an efficient deep-learning-based multi-scale registration method that is robust and blind to the large setting differences (focal, white balance, etc) between the two cameras. Using the registered location, the long-focal camera mounted on a gimbal enables real-time tracking of the ROI for continuous HR imaging.

My main subject now is underwater image enhancement, which aims to use deep learning technology to perform end-to-end image enhancement on degraded underwater images collected in the real underwater world, and has achieved preliminary results.

In addition, I am also very interested in the application of deep learning in the field of single-pixel imaging and the image enhancement technology of the new imaging device Spad Array.

In my free time, I enjoy gardening, photography and playing games.
