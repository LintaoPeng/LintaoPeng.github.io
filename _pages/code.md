## Dataset
### LSUI
LSUI is a large-scale underwater image dataset including 4279 image pairs, which covers more abundant underwater scenes(lighting conditions, water types and target categories)  and better visual quality reference images than existing underwater datasets . The dataset contains 4279 real-world underwater images, and the corresponding clear images are generated as comparison references. We also provide the semantic  segmentation  map and medium  transmission  map for each image.  You can download it from [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1dqB_k6agorQBVVqCda0vjA)(lsui). Our paper is under review, and once accepted, we will publish the corresponding  semantic  segmentation  map and media transfer map.

You can find the official PyTorch implementation of U-shape Transformer  for Underwater Image Enhancement. ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11843), [Dataset](https://lintaopeng.github.io/_pages/UIE%20Project%20Page.html), [video demo](https://lintaopeng.github.io/_pages/UIE%20Project%20Page.html), [visual results](https://lintaopeng.github.io/_pages/UIE%20Project%20Page.html)) in [here](https://github.com/LintaoPeng/U-shape_Transformer_for_Underwater_Image_Enhancement). U-shape Transformer achieves **state-of-the-art performance** in underwater image enhancement task.
